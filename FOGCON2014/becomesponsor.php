      	<h1>Become a FOGCON Sponsor</h1>
        <p>Traditionally most gaming corporations, and their local vendors have been sponsors at gaming convention. Vendors find it a great opportunity to introduce themselves to the community, especially to those newcomers to the gaming world, and an even better opportunity to introduce updates to games, or a new line of products to the veteran gamer. Yet this could be a great opportunity for non-gaming corporations, local vendors of related products, or individuals to become a sponsor. For instance, energy drink companies have sponsored without attending by delivering an advertizing poster or booth, where gamers can signup to win a prize. The members of Fans of Gaming welcome your ideas.</p>
