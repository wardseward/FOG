    	<h2>About Fans of Gaming (FOG)</h2>
        <p>Fans of Gaming was established to provide a premier gaming convention experience to all types of gamers in the Central Illinois Region. It was always foremost on the minds of the founders, when designing FOG CON, to create a gaming convention, one they themselves would enjoy attending.</p>
        <p>Like many diehard gamers, the founders of the Fans of Gaming have been gaming with their friends at home, and have attended gaming conventions for decades. Thus when developing FOG CON, its founders wanted to make sure they were providing a gaming convention experience open to all gamers.</p>
		<p>We hope to see you soon, that is, if we can see you through the â€œFOG of CON!"</p>
