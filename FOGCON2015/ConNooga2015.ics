DESCRIPTION:Thousands of years ago\, a defeated order of Osirian sages soug
 ht refuge in the perilous Pillars of the Sun in central Osirian. Until rece
 ntly they were presumed lost\, but recent exploration has uncovered the for
 tress sanctum they left behind. When the PCs delve into one of its sealed h
 alls\, they find the sages’ millennia-old projects dormant but not dead.\n\

DESCRIPTION:The metropolis of Absalom promotes commerce in its many forms\,
  and although slavery is legal\, it is increasingly common for citizens to 
 frown on the institution. The practice becomes more questionable when an al
 ly of the Pathfinder Society traces an attempt at supernatural surveillance
  through a slave. Sent as independent sleuths\, the PCs must track down the
  source of this espionage\, which takes them deep into underbelly of one of
  Absalom’s darkest industries.\n\nby Mark Garringer
